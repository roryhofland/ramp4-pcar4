# Navigation Controls

Navigation controls are used for changing the viewing extent of the map.

The following navigation controls can be found in the bottom right corner of the map:

- ![](navigation/zoomin.png) **Zoom in** 
    - *Key Binding:* plus (+)
    - Zoom in one level on the map to see more detailed content.
- ![](navigation/zoomout.png) **Zoom out** 
    - *Key Binding:* minus (-)
    - Zoom out one level on the map to see less detailed content.
- ![](navigation/fullscreen.png) **Fullscreen**
    - Full screen presents map content using the entire page. Full screen option is only available when the map is embedded into another page.
- ![](navigation/help.png) **Help**
    - Open the help panel.
- ![](navigation/home.png) **Home**
    - Zoom and pan map such that initial extent is visible.
- ![](navigation/basemaps.png) **Basemap**
    - Opens the basemap selection panel.

You can also pan the map by using your left, right, up and down arrow keys, or by click-holding on the map and dragging. Holding CTRL and using the mouse scroll wheel while hovering over the map will zoom the map in/out.

If you are panning the map using arrow keys, you can press SHIFT or CTRL to pan the map faster or slower (respectively).

Note that the map __must be__ focused for key binding to work.
